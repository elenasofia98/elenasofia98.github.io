### Welcome!

Hi! This is Elena, Ph.D. Student in [Data Science](https://datasciencephd.uniroma2.it/) in the [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://uniroma2.it) and I am part of the [Human Centric ART group](https://humancentricart.github.io/). 

My research revolves around Trustworthy AI principles, applied to language models.
I have been working expecially on robustness, security, interpretability, and fairness.
Recently, I have been focusing on studying and mitigating privacy risks in LLMs.
